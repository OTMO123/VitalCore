## üöÄ THE IMPACT WE'RE CREATING

### **Life-Saving Emergency Response**
Imagine a rural clinic in Kenya where a doctor speaks only Swahili, treating a tourist with chest pain who speaks only English. Traditional approach: 45 minutes for translator, potential misdiagnosis, delayed treatment.

**With IRIS + Gemma 3n**: 
- **30 seconds**: Real-time medical translation preserving clinical accuracy
- **60 seconds**: On-device AI triage assessment without internet connectivity  
- **90 seconds**: Risk stratification with similar case analysis
- **2 minutes**: Care plan in both languages with cultural sensitivity

**Result**: Myocardial infarction detected 43 minutes faster. Life saved.

### **Global Health Equity Revolution**
Our platform breaks down the three major barriers to healthcare access:

1. **Language Barriers** (affecting 25% of US patients)
   - Real-time medical translation in 40+ languages
   - Cultural adaptation of treatment recommendations
   - Medical terminology precision preservation

2. **Geographic Barriers** (60M Americans lack specialist access)
   - Complete offline functionality via Gemma 3n
   - Specialist-level AI consultation anywhere
   - Remote monitoring and care coordination

3. **Resource Barriers** (Healthcare waste: $760B annually)
   - AI-powered resource optimization
   - Predictive analytics reducing unnecessary procedures
   - Population health management at scale
