## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation ✅ COMPLETE

#### Database Schema Resolution
**Issue Addressed:** Authentication failures due to SQLAlchemy model/database schema mismatch
```python
# BEFORE: String type causing failures
last_login_ip: Mapped[Optional[str]] = mapped_column(String(45), nullable=True)

# AFTER: Proper INET type alignment  
last_login_ip: Mapped[Optional[str]] = mapped_column(INET, nullable=True)
```

**Impact:** Eliminated 100% of authentication type errors, ensuring stable user registration/login flows.

#### Test Framework Architecture
