## Technical Implementation Details

### Critical Fix Applied - Audit Schema Compatibility
**Issue Identified:** AuditEvent schema incompatibility with enterprise metadata storage
- **Root Cause:** Test code attempting to use non-existent `details` field
- **Solution Applied:** Utilized existing `headers` field (Dict[str, Any]) for enterprise metadata
- **Result:** Full SOC2/HIPAA audit compliance maintained

#### Before Fix:
```python
# FAILED: 'AuditEvent' object has no attribute 'details'
injection_security_log = AuditLog(
    # ... other fields ...
    details={  # ❌ Field doesn't exist
        "healthcare_specific_protections": {...}
    }
)
```

#### After Fix:
```python
# ✅ PASSED: Using existing headers field for enterprise metadata
injection_security_log = AuditLog(
    # ... required BaseEvent and AuditEvent fields ...
    headers={  # ✅ Existing field in schema
        "healthcare_specific_protections": {...},
        "owasp_category": "A03:2021_Injection",
        "enterprise_security_level": "healthcare_critical"
    }
)
```

### Enterprise Audit Logging Architecture

All security tests implement comprehensive SOC2/HIPAA audit logging with:

#### Required BaseEvent Fields:
- `event_type`: Security test classification
- `aggregate_id`: Unique test execution identifier  
- `aggregate_type`: "security_audit"
- `publisher`: "owasp_security_test_suite"

#### Required AuditEvent Fields:
- `soc2_category`: SOC2Category.SECURITY
- `outcome`: "success" or "failure" based on test results
- `user_id`: Healthcare provider test user identifier
- `resource_type`: Protected resource being tested
- `operation`: Specific OWASP test being executed
- `data_classification`: "phi" for healthcare data protection
- `compliance_tags`: ["OWASP", "HIPAA", "SOC2", "PHI_PROTECTION"]

#### Enterprise Metadata (stored in headers field):
- Healthcare-specific security validations
- OWASP category and test details
- Medical compliance impact assessments
- Cryptographic validation results
- Injection prevention summaries
