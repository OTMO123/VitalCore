} catch {
    Write-Host "❌ FAIL: $($_.Exception.Message)" -ForegroundColor Red
    return @{ Status = "FAIL"; Response = $null; Error = $_.Exception.Message }
}
```

#### 2. Health Monitoring Pattern
```powershell
$appReady = $false
$retries = 0
while (-not $appReady -and $retries -lt $maxRetries) {
    try {
        $health = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/health" -TimeoutSec 3
        if ($health.status -eq "healthy") { $appReady = $true }
    } catch {
        $retries++
        Start-Sleep -Seconds 3
    }
}
```

#### 3. Comprehensive Testing Pattern
```powershell
function Test-Endpoint {
    param([string]$Name, [string]$Method, [string]$Uri, [hashtable]$Headers = @{}, [string]$Body = $null)
    # Standardized endpoint testing with metrics collection
}
```
