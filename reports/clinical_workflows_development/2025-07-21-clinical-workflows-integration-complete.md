## üèóÔ∏è Integration Process

### 1. Core Infrastructure Setup

**Problem Solved**: Missing authentication and core service dependencies
**Solution**: Created unified authentication layer and integrated with existing security infrastructure

```python
# Created app/core/auth.py
- get_current_user(): JWT token validation
- require_roles(): Role-based access control
- Integrated with existing SecurityManager
- Compatible with all existing modules
```

### 2. Dependency Resolution

**Problem Solved**: Multiple import conflicts and missing dependencies
**Solution**: Systematic dependency resolution and compatibility updates

```python
# Fixed Import Issues:
- SecurityManager instead of EncryptionService
- SOC2AuditService instead of AuditService  
- HybridEventBus instead of EventBus
- BaseEvent instead of DomainEvent
- Corrected all exception class names
```

### 3. Database Model Compatibility

**Problem Solved**: SQLAlchemy compatibility issues with existing database structure
**Solution**: Updated models to match existing patterns and constraints

```python
# Model Updates:
- Fixed index references to use existing columns
- Updated foreign key relationships
- Corrected constraint definitions
- Ensured compatibility with SoftDeleteMixin
```

### 4. Router Integration

**Problem Solved**: FastAPI router compatibility and exception handling
**Solution**: Proper router configuration and main app integration

```python
# Router Fixes:
- Removed incompatible exception handlers from router
- Fixed rate limiting parameter names
- Corrected role-based dependency injection
- Added router to main FastAPI application
```

### 5. Main Application Integration

**Solution**: Successfully integrated clinical workflows into main FastAPI app

```python
# Added to app/main.py:
from app.modules.clinical_workflows.router import router as clinical_workflows_router

app.include_router(
    clinical_workflows_router,
    prefix="/api/v1/clinical-workflows",
    tags=["Clinical Workflows"],
    dependencies=[Depends(verify_token)]
)
