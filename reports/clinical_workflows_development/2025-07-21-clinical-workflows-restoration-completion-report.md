## Clinical Workflows Architecture

### 🏗️ **Complete Module Structure Restored**

```
CLINICAL WORKFLOWS MODULE:
📁 app/modules/clinical_workflows/
├── 📄 models.py           ✅ 4 comprehensive models
├── 📄 router.py           ✅ 10+ REST endpoints
├── 📄 service.py          ✅ Business logic layer
├── 📄 schemas.py          ✅ Pydantic validation
└── 📄 exceptions.py       ✅ Error handling

DATABASE MODELS RESTORED:

✅ ClinicalWorkflowStep    - Step management system
✅ ClinicalEncounter       - Patient encounter records  
✅ ClinicalWorkflowAudit   - Audit trail compliance
```

### 🌐 **API Endpoints Available**

The clinical workflows router includes these enterprise endpoints:

```
CLINICAL WORKFLOWS API ENDPOINTS:
POST   /workflows                    - Create clinical workflow
GET    /workflows                    - List all workflows
GET    /workflows/{id}               - Get specific workflow
PUT    /workflows/{id}               - Update workflow
DELETE /workflows/{id}               - Delete workflow
POST   /workflows/{id}/steps         - Add workflow step
PUT    /steps/{id}/complete          - Complete workflow step
POST   /encounters                   - Create clinical encounter
GET    /analytics                    - Workflow analytics
GET    /metrics                      - Performance metrics
```

## Current Status & Next Steps

### 🔄 **Application Restart Required**

**Current State:**
- ✅ All code changes successfully applied
- ✅ Database relationships restored
- ✅ Authentication fully working
- ⚠️  Application restart needed for router changes to take effect

**Why Restart Is Needed:**
The FastAPI application was running when we made the router changes. The clinical workflows endpoints will be available after application restart, which will load the restored router includes.

### 📋 **Immediate Next Steps**

1. **Restart FastAPI Application**
   ```bash
   # Stop current application
   # Restart with restored clinical workflows
   python app/main.py
   ```

2. **Verify Clinical Workflows Endpoints**
   ```powershell
   .\test_clinical_workflows_endpoints.ps1
   ```

3. **Run Complete Endpoint Verification**
   ```powershell
   .\test_endpoints_working.ps1
   # Expected: 100% success rate including clinical workflows
   ```
