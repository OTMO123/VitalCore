## 🔍 Test Environment Configuration - ENTERPRISE SECURE ✅

### Proper Test Authentication Implementation

**Current Status Analysis:**
- ✅ **Production Authentication**: Fully secure and functional
- ⚠️ **Test Environment**: Missing proper JWT token generation for tests
- ✅ **Security Architecture**: No compromises made to enterprise security

**Enterprise Test Solution Required:**
```python
# Enterprise Test JWT Generation
def create_test_jwt_token(user_id: str, role: str) -> str:
    """Create valid JWT token for enterprise testing"""
    payload = {
        "sub": user_id,
        "role": role,
        "user_id": user_id,
        "iat": datetime.utcnow(),
        "exp": datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(hours=1)
    }
    return jwt.encode(payload, settings.jwt_secret_key, algorithm="RS256")

# Test Implementation
test_token = create_test_jwt_token("test-admin", "admin")
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {test_token}"}
```

**Test Database Configuration:**
```python
# Enterprise Test Database Isolation
@pytest.fixture
async def enterprise_test_db():
    """Enterprise-grade test database with full security"""
    # Use real PostgreSQL with test schema isolation
    # Maintain all security controls and encryption
    # Implement proper cleanup without security shortcuts
```
