## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Strategy

### **SOLID Principles Implementation**

#### **Single Responsibility Principle**
```python
# ❌ Bad: Multiple responsibilities
class UserService:
    def authenticate_user(self, credentials): ...
    def send_email(self, user, message): ...
    def log_activity(self, user, action): ...

# ✅ Good: Single responsibility
class AuthenticationService:
    def authenticate_user(self, credentials): ...

class NotificationService:
    def send_email(self, user, message): ...

class AuditService:
    def log_activity(self, user, action): ...
```

#### **Open/Closed Principle**
```python
# ✅ Open for extension, closed for modification
class SecurityEventHandler(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def handle(self, event: SecurityEvent) -> None: ...

class LoginFailureHandler(SecurityEventHandler):
    async def handle(self, event: SecurityEvent) -> None:
        # Handle login failures

class PHIAccessHandler(SecurityEventHandler):
    async def handle(self, event: SecurityEvent) -> None:
        # Handle PHI access events
```

#### **Liskov Substitution Principle**
```python
# ✅ Derived classes are substitutable
class EncryptionService(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def encrypt(self, data: str) -> str: ...

class AESEncryptionService(EncryptionService):
    async def encrypt(self, data: str) -> str:
        # AES implementation

class RSAEncryptionService(EncryptionService):
    async def encrypt(self, data: str) -> str:
        # RSA implementation
```

#### **Interface Segregation Principle**
```python
# ✅ Client-specific interfaces
class ReadOnlyUserRepository(Protocol):
    async def get_by_id(self, user_id: str) -> User: ...

class WriteOnlyUserRepository(Protocol):
    async def create(self, user: User) -> str: ...

class FullUserRepository(ReadOnlyUserRepository, WriteOnlyUserRepository):
    # Complete implementation
```

#### **Dependency Inversion Principle**
```python
# ✅ Depend on abstractions
class PatientService:
    def __init__(
        self,
        repository: PatientRepository,  # Abstract
        encryption: EncryptionService,  # Abstract
        audit: AuditService            # Abstract
    ):
        self.repository = repository
        self.encryption = encryption
        self.audit = audit
```

### **Test-Driven Development Implementation**

#### **TDD Cycle Example**
```python
# 1. RED: Write failing test
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_phi_access_requires_consent():
    """Test that PHI access requires patient consent"""
    # This test will fail initially
    patient_service = PatientService()
    
    with pytest.raises(ConsentRequiredError):
        await patient_service.get_phi_data(
            patient_id="123",
            user_id="456",
            consent_provided=False
        )

# 2. GREEN: Write minimal code to pass
class PatientService:
    async def get_phi_data(self, patient_id: str, user_id: str, consent_provided: bool):
        if not consent_provided:
            raise ConsentRequiredError("Patient consent required for PHI access")
        # Minimal implementation

# 3. REFACTOR: Improve code while keeping tests green
class PatientService:
    def __init__(self, consent_service: ConsentService):
        self.consent_service = consent_service
    
    async def get_phi_data(self, patient_id: str, user_id: str, access_purpose: str):
        consent_valid = await self.consent_service.verify_consent(
            patient_id, user_id, access_purpose
        )
        if not consent_valid:
            raise ConsentRequiredError("Valid consent required for PHI access")
        
        # Enhanced implementation with proper consent verification
```

### **Domain-Driven Design Implementation**

#### **Bounded Context Design**
```python
# Healthcare Records Context
class Patient(Entity):
    """Rich domain entity with business logic"""
    def __init__(self, patient_id: PatientId, medical_record_number: MRN):
        self.id = patient_id
        self.mrn = medical_record_number
        self.consents = ConsentCollection()
    
    def grant_consent(self, consent: Consent) -> None:
        """Domain logic for consent management"""
        if not consent.is_valid():
            raise InvalidConsentError("Consent must be valid")
        self.consents.add(consent)
        self.raise_event(ConsentGrantedEvent(self.id, consent))

# Value Objects
class PatientId(ValueObject):
    def __init__(self, value: str):
        if not self._is_valid(value):
            raise ValueError("Invalid patient ID format")
        self.value = value
    
    def _is_valid(self, value: str) -> bool:
        # Validation logic
        return bool(re.match(r'^PAT-\d{8}$', value))

# Domain Services
class ConsentValidationService:
    """Complex business logic that doesn't belong to entities"""
    def validate_consent_for_purpose(
        self, 
        consent: Consent, 
        purpose: AccessPurpose
    ) -> bool:
        # Complex consent validation logic
        pass
```

### **Security-First Architecture**

#### **Defense in Depth Implementation**
```python
# Layer 1: Network Security
@app.middleware("http")
async def security_headers_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
    response = await call_next(request)
    response.headers.update(SECURITY_HEADERS)
    return response

# Layer 2: Authentication
@app.middleware("http")
async def authentication_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
    if requires_auth(request.url.path):
        await verify_jwt_token(request)
    return await call_next(request)

# Layer 3: Authorization
def require_permission(permission: str):
    def decorator(func):
        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            if not await check_permission(current_user, permission):
                raise HTTPException(403, "Insufficient permissions")
            return await func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

# Layer 4: Data Protection
async def encrypt_phi_data(data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    encrypted_data = {}
    for field, value in data.items():
        if is_phi_field(field):
            encrypted_data[field] = await encryption_service.encrypt(
                value, 
                context={"field": field, "classification": "PHI"}
            )
        else:
            encrypted_data[field] = value
    return encrypted_data
