## Deployment Process

### ✅ Phase 1: Database Setup
```bash
# 1. Backup existing data (if applicable)
./deploy.sh backup

# 2. Run database migrations
./deploy.sh migrate

# 3. Verify database schema
docker-compose exec db psql -U postgres -d iris_db -c "\dt"
```

### ✅ Phase 2: Application Deployment
```bash
# 1. Deploy all services
./deploy.sh deploy

# 2. Verify all services are running
docker-compose ps

# 3. Check application health
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### ✅ Phase 3: Service Verification
```bash
# 1. Test authentication
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"testuser","email":"test@company.com","password":"SecurePass123!"}'

# 2. Test IRIS API health (should require authentication)
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/iris/health

# 3. Test audit logging
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/audit/health

# 4. Test healthcare records
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/healthcare/health
```
