  - JTI tracking for replay attack prevention
  - Comprehensive security claims and validation

  2. Immutable Audit Logging with Hash Chaining
  - Blockchain-style integrity verification with hash chaining      
  - AES-256-GCM encrypted audit logs for PHI compliance
  - SOC2/HIPAA compliant audit trails with 7-year retention
  - Tamper-evident logging with checksum validation

  3. Field-Level PHI Encryption (AES-256-GCM)
  - Context-aware encryption with patient-specific keys
  - PBKDF2 key derivation for enhanced security
  - Authenticated encryption with additional data (AAD)
  - Support for legacy Fernet encryption with migration path        

  4. Circuit Breaker Protection
  - Service isolation with configurable failure thresholds
  - Automatic recovery testing and metrics collection
  - Protection for database, encryption, IRIS API, and event        
  bus
  - Comprehensive state monitoring and manual reset
  capabilities

  5. Advanced Rate Limiting
  - Per-client rate limiting with configurable thresholds
  - Failed login attempt tracking with account lockout
  - Security event monitoring and alerting
  - Integration with audit logging for compliance

  6. Production Patient API Endpoints
  - FHIR R4 compliant patient management
  - PHI access validation with minimum necessary rule
  - Comprehensive audit logging for all operations
  - Circuit breaker protection for all database and encryption      
  operations

  - Circuit breaker state monitoring
  - Failed authentication attempt analysis
  - PHI access audit trails
  - Encryption operation metrics

  ðŸŽ¯ Threat Model Compliance

  All critical threats from the security architecture document      
  have been addressed:

  - S1 (JWT Token Compromise): RS256 with short expiry and JTI      
  tracking
  - T1 (Audit Log Tampering): Hash chaining with integrity
  verification
  - I1 (PHI Information Disclosure): Field-level encryption and     
   access controls
  - D1 (DoS Attacks): Rate limiting and circuit breaker
  protection
  - E1 (Privilege Escalation): Comprehensive RBAC and audit
  logging

  The system now implements Defense in Depth with multiple
  security layers, following SOC2 and HIPAA compliance
  requirements for healthcare data protection.
