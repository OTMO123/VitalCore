Excellent choice! The hybrid approach will give us flexibility while maintaining clarity. Before I start crafting the high-priority tests, let me ask your senior developer some key questions to ensure our tests align perfectly with your system:

## Context Questions for the Senior Developer:

### 1. **Authentication & Token Management**
- What's the JWT token structure you're using? (claims, expiration strategy)
- Are you using refresh tokens, or just access tokens?
- How are roles defined in your RBAC system? (e.g., ADMIN, DOCTOR, NURSE, PATIENT)

### 2. **PHI Encryption Implementation**
- Which fields are marked for encryption in your models?
- Are you using field-level encryption or encrypting entire records?
- Is the encryption service (`AES-256`) already initialized in the test fixtures?

### 3. **Database & Fixtures**
- Do the Docker test containers auto-migrate the schema?
- Are there any specific test database naming conventions?
- Which fixtures handle test user creation with proper roles?

### 4. **FHIR Validation**
- Are you validating against specific FHIR R4 profiles or just base resources?
- Which FHIR resources are most critical? (Patient, Observation, DocumentReference?)
- Any custom business rules on top of FHIR validation?

### 5. **Event Bus & Background Tasks**
- What events are most critical to test? (PHI access, consent changes?)
- Is Celery running in test mode or do we mock it?
- Any specific event ordering requirements?

### 6. **Existing Test Patterns**
- Any specific assertion patterns or custom matchers you're already using?
- Preferred way to handle test data cleanup? (transactions, truncate, etc.)
- Any module-specific test helpers I should know about?

These answers will help me write tests that slot right into your existing infrastructure. Think of it like a new surgeon joining your hospital - they need to know your specific protocols, not just general medical knowledge.

**Which of these areas should I assume standard implementations for, and which have unique aspects I need to understand?**

 Context Questions Answered:

  1. Authentication & Token Management

  - JWT Structure: Standard claims (exp, iat, iss, sub, jti) + custom (user_id, username, role, email)
  - Token Strategy: Access tokens only (30min default), NO refresh tokens
  - RBAC Roles: ["user", "admin", "super_admin"] with hierarchical permissions
  - Algorithm: HS256 with python-jose

  2. PHI Encryption Implementation

  - Encrypted Fields: first_name_encrypted, last_name_encrypted, ssn_encrypted, date_of_birth_encrypted, content_encrypted
  - Strategy: Field-level encryption with AES-256-GCM via Fernet
  - Context-Aware: Each field encrypted with metadata (field, patient_id, algorithm, key_version)
  - Service: EncryptionService in app/core/security.py is fully initialized

  3. Database & Fixtures

  - Migration: Complete migration exists but NOT APPLIED (run alembic upgrade head)
  - Test DB: Uses advanced schema (database_advanced.py) with 15+ healthcare tables
  - Docker: Auto-migrate in containers via docker-compose.test.yml
  - Fixtures: 40+ comprehensive fixtures in conftest.py with user roles, auth tokens, test data

  4. FHIR Validation

  - Profiles: US Core + IRIS-specific immunization profiles
  - Critical Resources: Patient, Immunization, DocumentReference, Observation
  - Business Rules: Future date validation, status consistency, required extensions
  - Validator: Complete FHIRValidator class in healthcare_records/fhir_validator.py

  5. Event Bus & Background Tasks

  - Critical Events: PHIAccessed, PatientCreated, ConsentUpdated, ComplianceReportGenerated
  - Celery: Real Celery with separate queues (phi_processing, healthcare_monitoring)
  - Ordering: Per-aggregate ordering with memory-first + PostgreSQL durability
  - Tasks: PHI encryption, consent monitoring, compliance reporting (6-hour, hourly, 30-min schedules)

  6. Existing Test Patterns

  - Fixtures: Session-scoped engines, test-scoped sessions with auto-rollback
  - Cleanup: Automatic via session rollback + cleanup_database fixture
  - Helpers: Rich CLI test runner, Docker container manager, performance timers
  - Conventions: 15+ pytest markers, async fixtures, comprehensive mock services

  Key Implementation Details:

  Authentication Flow:
  # Token creation includes role hierarchy validation
  token_data = {"sub": username, "user_id": str(user.id), "role": user.role}
  # Role checking via decorator: @Depends(require_role("admin"))

  PHI Encryption Pattern:
  # Field-level with context
  encrypted_value = await encryption.encrypt(
      value,
      context={'field': 'ssn', 'patient_id': patient.id}
  )

  Test Infrastructure Status:
  - ✅ Infrastructure: 40+ fixtures, Docker containers, Rich CLI
  - ❌ Implementation Gap: NO ACTUAL TESTS - highest priority

  Database Migration Required:
  # Critical: Apply migration first
  alembic upgrade head
