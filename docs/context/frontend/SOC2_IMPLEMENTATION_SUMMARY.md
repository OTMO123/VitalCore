- ✅ General components: >99.5% uptime requirement  
- ✅ Automatic failover: <30 seconds

**System Monitoring (CC7.2)**:
- ✅ Continuous monitoring of all critical components
- ✅ Backup monitoring during primary system failures
- ✅ Comprehensive audit logging with integrity validation

**Logical Access Controls (CC6.1)**:
- ✅ Authentication tracking for all SOC2 operations

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Circuit Breaker Configuration

```python
# Critical components (strict thresholds)
dashboard_activities: failure_threshold=2, timeout=15s
security_summary: failure_threshold=2, timeout=15s

# General components (relaxed thresholds)  
dashboard_stats: failure_threshold=3, timeout=30s
```

### Backup System Activation

**Automatic Triggers**:
- Critical component circuit breaker opens
- Primary audit logging fails
- Security monitoring system failure

**Manual Triggers**:
- Admin-initiated via REST API
- Emergency incident response procedures

### Audit Logging Strategy

**Primary**: PostgreSQL database with structured logging
**Backup**: Filesystem-based JSONL files with integrity hashes
**Retention**: Configurable per SOC2 requirements
**Restoration**: Automatic restoration to primary when available
